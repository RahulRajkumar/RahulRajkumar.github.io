                <h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>

<p>I earned my Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics at NYU in May 2020. I am currently a first-year Ph.D. student in the UC Riverside Department of Mathematics. Outside of mathematics I enjoy playing saxophone in concert bands and small ensembles, cooking, and reading speculative fiction.</p>

<p>Please feel free to contact me at rahul.rajkumar [at] email.ucr.edu</p>

<h2 id="research-interests">Research Interests</h2>

<p>I am broadly interested in the use of mathematics to shape a better and more just society. To this end, some of my interests include applied category theory, complex systems, computer science, and economics.</p>

<h2 id="outreach">Outreach</h2>

<p>While at NYU, I volunteered with <a href="http://www.csplash.org">Courant Splash (cSplash)</a>, an annual lecture series aim at mathematically-inclined high school students in the New York City metropolitan area. During my tenure as a director for my final two years, we forged connections with NYU’s physics department. We also successfully debuted the first online Splash in cSplash’s 15 year history during the 2020 COVID-19 shutdown of New York City. I hope to bring my experience to Riverside and establish a Splash for the Inland Empire region.</p>
